Code to analyze events.

### Files
* `lhcbStyle.h`: The usual style options
* `trajectory.h`: Point and Trajectory (adds a direction)
* `data.h`: struct for holding data
* `hits.h`: Hit and Hits, one is a point in space, the other a collection of overlapping phi bins of hits
* `triplet.h`: getTrackPairs, getPDF, Triplet class
* `tracks.h`: Tracks hold triplets
* `utils.h`: FCN, kernel, kernelMax, pvCategory, svCategory
* `plot.c`: Contains plotz, plotxy
* `makehist.c`: Convert a hit file into a z-histogram file

You need Pythia installed to generate events, but there is a file there with 10 events with 10 (visible) collisions each to play with. Obviously weâ€™ll need to generate more events, but this is fast (just want to finalize the file format first).

Under the this dir, you can do:

## Converting data

Use:

```bash
root -b -q 'makehist.C+("2018xxxx")'
```


```cpp
.L plot.C
```

then

```cpp
plotz(0); // plot the max kernel value at each z for event 0
plotxy(0,1,val); // plot the 2-d kernel in xy at the z value of pv 1 with shift of val
```

`plotxy(0,1,0)` would draw the 2-d kernel in the x-y plane at the z value of the i=1 pv in the event with index 0.  Doing `plotxy(1,2,0.5)` would draw the same thing for event 1 for its pv with index 2 shifted by +0.5mm in z, etc. I.e., the first argument is the C-style index to the event, the 2nd argument is the C-style index to the PV array for this event, and the z value of that PV is used as the default z value for building the kernel, the last argument lets you shift in z (+ or -) from that default.


## Notebook

To run on Goofy:

```bash
ssh goofy -L 8888:localhost:8888
ml anaconda
cd <the ana directory>
jupyter lab --no-browser
```

Copy and paste the `http://localhost:8888/...` link into your browser on your local computer.
